		}/>,

	]}
</p>

### Motivation

After maintaining several applications, I ran into the issues of:

- quickly creating & iterating on features
- extracting code to reuse
- time to refactor code
- time to upgrade software
- gluing together small libraries & snippets

Using existing solutions such as frameworks or libraries provides the benefit of quickly getting started, however
there is a maintenance burden of:

- large payload size & memory usage
- extending the underlying software to fulfill requirements
- time to upgrade the application with the underlying libraries
- domain language mismatch between the library/framework

<p>
	{[
		`I found that there are usually small libraries & code snippets that can be glued together with a `,
		<R $={
			atb_naming_convention_({ innerText: 'naming convention' })
		}/>,
		` that utilizes unique, immutable, & composable names. As a result, one could find all usages of an entity or
		concept by doing a project-wide search. Rename refactorings were more accurate & comprehensive due to the
		uniqueness of names. Composable naming allows one to understand the context & full description of the entity.`
	]}
</p>

I use ctx-core to maintain software with:

- an accessible domain model
- a flat architecture
- active programming

### Usage

ctx-core uses dependency-injection of a `ctx` `MapCtx|NestedMapCtx` & "beings", (a function created with the `be_`
factory function). The flat architecture reduces incidental complexity. To manage complex domains, Nested architecture
provides scoping. The [Tag Vector](/posts/tag-vector-0-introduction) Convention, created while working on ctx-core,
encodes tags joined by vectors & data structure shapes to express complex domains within a flat architecture.

Desert is a Rails plugin framework that makes it easy to share models, views, controllers, helpers, routes, and
migrations across your applications.

With Desert, reusability doesn’t come at the cost of extensibility: it’s trivial to extend the functionality of a
plugin - both in your application and in other plugins.

Classes are automatically mixed in with your own or other plugins’ classes. This allows you to make full featured
composable components.
