			ctx-core has been a bit of a catch-all project to share code between projects under the principles of ctx-core. The
			functionality of ctx-core is in place but the packages need some reorganization & documentation is needed to be more
			widely used. I have used ctx-core to handle transitions between other component & state management libraries as they

</p>
I use ctx-core to maintain software with:

- an accessible domain model
- a flat architecture
- active programming

ctx-core uses dependency-injection of a `ctx` `MapCtx|NestedMapCtx` & "beings", (a function created with the `be_`
factory function). The flat architecture reduces incidental complexity. To manage complex domains, Nested architecture
provides scoping. The [Tag Vector](/posts/tag-vector-0-introduction) Convention, created while working on ctx-core,
encodes tags joined by vectors & data structure shapes to express complex domains within a flat architecture.
