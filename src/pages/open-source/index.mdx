		`.`)
]}/>

### Motivation

After maintaining several applications, I ran into the issues of:

- quickly creating & iterating on features
- extracting code to reuse
- time to refactor code
- time to upgrade software
- gluing together small libraries & snippets

Using existing solutions such as frameworks or libraries provides the benefit of quickly getting started, however
there is a maintenance burden of:

- large payload size & memory usage
- extending the underlying software to fulfill requirements
- time to upgrade the application with the underlying libraries
- domain language mismatch between the library/framework

<R $={p_(
	`I found that there are usually small libraries & code snippets that can be glued together with a `,
	naming_convention__tb_a_('naming convention'), ` that utilizes unique, immutable, & composable names.
	As a result, one could find all usages of an entity or concept by doing a project-wide search. Rename refactorings
	were more accurate & comprehensive due to the uniqueness of names. Composable naming allows one to understand the
	context & full description of the entity.`
)}/>

I use ctx-core to maintain software with:

- an accessible domain model
- a flat architecture
- active programming

### Usage

ctx-core uses dependency-injection of a `ctx` `MapCtx|NestedMapCtx` & "beings", (a function created with the `be_`
factory function). The flat architecture reduces incidental complexity. To manage complex domains, Nested architecture
provides scoping. The [Tag Vector](/posts/tag-vector-0-introduction) Convention, created while working on ctx-core,
encodes tags joined by vectors & data structure shapes to express complex domains within a flat architecture.

	`Currently, I use ctx-core along with `, nanostores__tb_a_(), ` to manage reactive state on the server & the browser.
	 ctx-core is a general purpose library & since nanostores is also a general purpose library any component library
