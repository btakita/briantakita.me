I create full stack software solutions. My current preferred tooling is::

- monorepos
- [ctx-core](https://github.com/ctx-core/ctx-core)
- [Bunjs](https://github.com/ctx-core/ctx-core)
- [Astrojs](https://astro.build/)
- [Nanostores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)
- [Solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

With over 20 years of profession development experience, I have been a part of many projects & fantastic teams. See a 
[portfolio](/portfolio) of some of my work.

## Crafting software since 2002 with 💖

Personal systems has been an instrumental tool in working with the chaos of the world. From starting my career 
during the .com collapse, through consulting gigs with startups, to the ever-changing tech/cultural landscape, I 
strive to create continuity in work, family, personal meditation, & the panoply of modern life.

## 👊🏼 Skin in the game

I love the collaborative creative energy in startup companies. The team has a goal to make an impact & to reach the 
next level of funding. Concentrated talent with strong opinions. Unifying process & tooling is necessary for 
effective collaboration. Pressure to fulfil expectations & metrics drives the engine of creation. A well-oiled 
machine is beautiful.

Though I seek a better way that aligns with my personal systems to use continuity to drive the creative process. My 
belief is that effective individuals & small talented teams make the most impact. Free of mediating procedural 
burdens, raw talent brings creativity, especially if team coheres naturally.

So I sought to create my own systems & work as a freelance consultant in 2012.

## 🌐 Open Source Software

Open source software creates continuity, particularly in the tooling, libraries, & frameworks proving a foundation 
for products.

Proprietary systems are a common secret sauce of an enterprise to participate with & be rewarded by the market. 
There are open source products, but in the current market, the product most often is the revenue driver. Yes, 
services also drive in revenue, like in my case, yet a product to attract people fuels the production. 

As a consulting developer working on many projects, a common toolchain helps to use work & know-how with other 
engagements. Open source libraries & frameworks are available for developers to use. This re-use provides tooling 
that would otherwise need to be built from scratch, saving effort & time. The programmer needs to interface with 
these libraries.

## 🗓 Flatish Architecture & Name Systems

Abstraction is used to organize software libraries. 

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
> -- Phil Karlton

Naming conventions are much loved to bring organization & familiarity to a codebase. Javascript is a flexible & 
dynamic language. The community has largely settled on camelCase name convention to join words. Yet camelCase has 
some disadvantages. For one, the case of a word can change depending on where it is located in the variable name. 
The first word is lower case while subsequent words are Upper Case. When maintaining a codebase, global searches are 
commonly used. 

## 🌙 Divination

Writing software effectively is creating a logic model that a machine can execute. The interface between the 
programmer & the machine. Similar to writing, programming allows one to organize an ontology using abstractions. The 
executable software provides feedback on the logical consistency of the model. If there are logic issues, there are 
bugs. With tools such as type systems, tests, & validations, the software will result in errors.

The programmer can build on the creations of others, using the interface the other programmer created.

## Identity

Artists are mostly identified by their creations, drawing the audience to know them.
