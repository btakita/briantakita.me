Creating Web Components/Web Apps has never been more pleasurable. It's out with the old & in with the new. I
converted my client's project to use Svelte JS from Riot JS. This post highlights some considerations why I chose
Svelte & a a sample web component using Svelte.
<p>
	{[
		<Atb_sveltejs/>,
		` is a build-time isomorphic library that utilizes a transpilation process to build completely self-contained
		web components.`
	]}
</p>
<p>
	{[
		<Atb_riotjs/>,
		` is a runtime isomorphic component library.`
	]}
</p>
<p>
	{[
		`I recently `,
		<Atb innerText="converted this site" href="/posts/monorepo-static-sites-using-sveltejs-rollup-bash"></Atb>,
		` to svelte from `,
		<Atb_metalsmithjs/>,
		`, which is a static site generator.`
	]}

While it's easy to get stuck into the rat race of endless technological upgrades & porting to the latest hyped piece
of tech&hellip;

## Performance & Memory Usage
<p>
	{[
		`Despite beinga young library, svelte `,
		<Atb href="https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html">
			does quite well
		</Atb>,
		` on krausest/js-framework-benchmark for Performance & Memory Usage. That's because, Svelte JS generates optimal
		javascript while not having the overhead of a runtime library. It's also going to have an advantage in page load
		time due to not requiring a runtime library to be loaded.`
	]}

## HTML-based Components

HTML is the lingua franca of the world wide web. HTML the lowest common denominator (developers, designers,
non-technical) can work with. With Svelte, the HTML file is converted to be a Component. Components can use other
Components.

I feel confident that I will continue to use Svelte for a long time. Since it's design is simple & well thought out
(all of my use cases were supported with elegance), I don't expect to have upgrade pains that plague some of the
larger frameworks out there.

## APIs

Svelte's api idioms are well thought out. Development flow was coherent natural during the port from Riot.

		`For each of my professional clients, I usea monorepo using the `,
		<Atb_ctx_core/>,
		` toolkit. ctx-core has supporting architecture of a dependency injected ctx (context), agents, & build tools.`
