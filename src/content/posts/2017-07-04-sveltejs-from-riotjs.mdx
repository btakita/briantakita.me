Creating Web Components/Web Apps has never been more pleasurable. It's out with the old & in with the new. I
converted my client's project to use Svelte JS from Riot JS. This post highlights some considerations why I chose
Svelte & a sample web component using Svelte.

<R $={p_(
	atb_sveltejs_(), ` is a build-time isomorphic library that utilizes a transpilation process to build completely
	self-contained web components.`
)}/>

<R $={p_(
	atb_riotjs_(), ` is a runtime isomorphic component library.`
)}/>

<R $={p_(
	`I recently `, atb_({ href: '/posts/monorepo-static-sites-using-sveltejs-rollup-bash'}, 'converted this site'),
	` to svelte from `, atb_metalsmithjs_(), `, which is a static site generator.`
)}/>

While it's easy to get stuck into the rat race of endless technological upgrades & porting to the latest hyped piece
of tech&hellip;

## Performance & Memory Usage
<R $={p_(
	`Despite beinga young library, svelte `,
	atb_({ href: 'https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html' },
		'does quite well'), ` on krausest/js-framework-benchmark for Performance & Memory Usage. That's because, Svelte
	JS generates optimal javascript while not having the overhead of a runtime library. It's also going to have an
	advantage in page load time due to not requiring a runtime library to be loaded.`
)}/>

## HTML-based Components

HTML is the lingua franca of the world wide web. HTML the lowest common denominator (developers, designers,
non-technical) can work with. With Svelte, the HTML file is converted to be a Component. Components can use other
Components.

I feel confident that I will continue to use Svelte for a long time. Since it's design is simple & well thought out
(all of my use cases were supported with elegance), I don't expect to have upgrade pains that plague some of the
larger frameworks out there.

## APIs

Svelte's api idioms are well thought out. Development flow was coherent natural during the port from Riot.

<R $={p_(
	`For each of my professional clients, I usea monorepo using the `, atb_ctx_core_(), ` toolkit. ctx-core has
	supporting architecture of a dependency injected ctx (context), agents, & build tools.`
)}/>

<R $={p_(
	`You can `, atb_({ href: 'https://svelte.dev/docs' }, 'read more about the features of svelte'), `.`
)}/>
