  Creating Web Components/Web Apps has never been more pleasurable. It's out with the old & in with the new. I
  converted my client's project to use Svelte JS from Riot JS. This post highlights some considerations why I chose
  Svelte & a sample web component using Svelte.

Creating Web Components/Web Apps has never been more pleasurable. It's out with the old & in with the new. I

<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment({ ctx },
			V_atb_sveltejs({ ctx }),
			` is a build-time isomorphic library that utilizes a transpilation process to build completely self-contained
			web components.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment({ ctx },
			V_atb_riotjs({ ctx }),
			` is a runtime isomorphic component library.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment({ ctx },
			`I recently `,
			V_atb({ ctx,
				innerText: 'converted this site',
				href: '/posts/monorepo-static-sites-using-sveltejs-rollup-bash'}),
			` to svelte from `,
			V_atb_metalsmithjs({ ctx }),
			`, which is a static site generator.`)
	}/>

While it's easy to get stuck into the rat race of endless technological upgrades & porting to the latest hyped piece
of tech&hellip;

## Performance & Memory Usage
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment({ ctx },
			`Despite beinga young library, svelte `,
			V_atb({ ctx,
				href: 'https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html'
			}, 'does quite well'),
			` on krausest/js-framework-benchmark for Performance & Memory Usage. That's because, Svelte JS generates
			optimal javascript while not having the overhead of a runtime library. It's also going to have an advantage in
			page load time due to not requiring a runtime library to be loaded.`
		)
	}/>
</p>

## HTML-based Components

HTML is the lingua franca of the world wide web. HTML the lowest common denominator (developers, designers,
non-technical) can work with. With Svelte, the HTML file is converted to be a Component. Components can use other
Components.

I feel confident that I will continue to use Svelte for a long time. Since it's design is simple & well thought out
(all of my use cases were supported with elegance), I don't expect to have upgrade pains that plague some of the
larger frameworks out there.

## APIs

Svelte's api idioms are well thought out. Development flow was coherent natural during the port from Riot.

	<Van dom={
		V_fragment({ ctx },
			`For each of my professional clients, I usea monorepo using the `,
			V_atb_ctx_core({ ctx }),
			` toolkit. ctx-core has supporting architecture of a dependency injected ctx (context), agents, & build tools.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment({ ctx },
			`You can `,
			V_atb({ ctx,
				innerText: 'read more about the features of svelte',
				href: 'https://svelte.dev/docs'
			}),
			`.`)
	}/>
