I’m evolving a philosophy that has it’s own domain language. The domain language is similar to their common cultural
definitions, however, I expand the scope of these words. Expanding the scope of these words enables conceptual
patterns to be reused across different scopes in Existence.

<h1>
	<Rel dom={
		fragment_(
			`A tool to explore `,
			atb_existence_())
	}/>
</h1>

My motive is to build a tool that can use everyday terminology to explore the scope of Existence. The domain is
Existence & the task is to create a domain language to explore Existence.

Since the meanings of words are subjective to the entity’s domain knowledge of & experience with the abstraction, I
feel justified in defining the words to match the domain of Existence.

<h1>
	<Rel dom={
		fragment_(
			atb_abstraction_(),
			`, `,
			atb_scope_(),
			`, Zooming In/Out`)
	}/>
</h1>

We humans can hold a limited amount of information in our head. If we are to focus on all Existence, then the
abstractions are broad. If we wish to focus on a particular abstraction, we can zoom in on that abstraction. When
zooming in, the scope is smaller than Existence & context is applied to the new domain model. This allows words to contextually apply to the scope. The words still have a similar meaning in the zoomed in scope as in the scope of Existence.

For example, if we wish to focus on the Physical Universe, Physical Existence means an object exists in the physical
world. Abstract thoughts are not in Physical Existence, so an abstract thought does not physically exist.

<h1>
	<Rel dom={
		fragment_(
			atb_god_(),
			` Exists`)
	}/>
</h1>

I’m happy to utilize, and prove, God’s existence. Since Existence is God and Existence, well exists, God Exists in
this Philosophy. It’s about how God & Existence is defined.

While there has been some critique on Ann Rand’s statement “Existence Exists”, these critiques are based on the
definition of “exists” being scoped to mean “physical existence”.
<p>
	<Rel dom={
		fragment_(
			`The “Existence is God” Philosophy defines existence as “Everything that ‘is’, or more simply, everything" or
				the `,
			atb_universal_set_(),
			` of everything. That includes all thoughts ever thought, all possible concepts, including the notion of
				Existence being everything. Thus Existence Exists. Everything (even fiction) exists. Thus God Exists.`)
	}/>

I enjoy speaking to atheists because ideas from atheism led to me expanding the scope of God. Also, atheists tend to
be skeptical toward dogmas, which leads to further exploration. This exploration expands consciousness.

# Exploration & Collaboration

In our present culture, redefining words and the subject of the existence of God are controversial topics. These
controversies and paradoxes are ripe for exploration & expanding consciousness.

If you wish to explore some of these concepts with me, please contact me or leave a comment!
