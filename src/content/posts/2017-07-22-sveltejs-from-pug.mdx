Now it's time to implement server side rendering (SSR) using SvelteJS.

SvelteJS allows one to render in dom & server side environments. SSR is simpler than DOM rendering since Svelte does
not worry about `oncreate`, `ondestroy`, or `events`, or `methods`. `data` & `computed properties` still work to
create the properties and `helpers` are also available.

Svelte SSR is fully capable of replacing any server side html/xml templating system. For my current project, I
replaced PUG.

Here's a relatively full-featured example of the Isomorphic Svelte components that utilize hydration.

One the server side, the `__SSR` component (`Index__SSR.html`) wraps the content (`Index.html`) component. On the
dom, the `Index.html` component is rehydrated when loaded.

This allows html to be generated on the server side (enabling HTTP caching), while allowing dynamic behavior to be
`rehydrated` in the dom.

All of this happens solely in Svelte components, creating a unified architecture for both server side & dom rendering.
