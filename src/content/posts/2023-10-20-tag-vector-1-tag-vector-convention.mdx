The tag `person` has a higher inference level than `name` as `name` is an attribute of `person`.

```ts
const person_name = 'Elon Musk'
// person & name are tags
// person & name are connected as a 1 dimensional right-arrow vector: person->name
```

### Inferred vectors can also run left `<-`

Is inference, vectors can also be in the left direction:

```ts
const name_person = 'Elon Musk'
// name is inferred to be downstream of person
// The vector is name<-person
```

### Default Direction when tags are on the same inferential level

If two tags are on the same inferential level, such as `person` & `company`, the vector arrow will be `->` by
default.

```ts
const person_company = { name: 'SpaceX' }
// person->company
````

The default direction can also be `<-` (left). A `<-` default direction should be documented. Future
tooling will include the default direction for code & text analysis.

```ts
// <- default
const company_company = { name: 'SpaceX' }
// company<-person
```

### Overriding the Default Direction

The default direction can be overridden in code with a comment above or before the statement.

```ts
// <-
const company_company = { name: 'SpaceX' }
// company<-person
```

### tag vectors with 3 or more tags

A tag vector can be composed of any number of tags. The inference level rules are applied to the first & last tag.
In the following case:

```ts
const company_person_name = 'Elon Musk'
// inferred as company->person->name
```

the `company` & `name` tags are inferred against each other. `company` has a higher inference level than `name` so
the inferred direction is `->`. Conversely:

```ts
const name_person_company = 'Elon Musk'
// inferred as name<-person<-company
```

is in the `<-` direction from inferring `name` having a lower inference level than `company`.

An ambiguous inference level follows the same rules above:

```ts
const person_registry_company = { name: 'SpaceX' }
// person->registry->company
```

or

```ts
// <- default
const company_registry_person = { name: 'SpaceX' }
// company<-registry<-person
```

## multi-dimension tag vectors

Multiple tag vectors can also be composed into a multi-dimension tag vector.

```ts
const highest_net_worth__company_person_name = 'Elon Musk'
// highest->net->worth-->company->person->name
```

The multi-vector is composed to two vectors `highest->net->worth` & `company->person->name` with a `-->`. Note there
are two underscores `__` used to join the single underscore `_` tag vectors.

Additional dimensions can be chained together:

```ts
const as_of_2023__highest_net_worth__company_person_name = 'Elon Musk'
// as->of->2023-->highest->net->worth-->company->person->name
```

The inference levels of the name vectors are compared, with the more abstract has a higher inference level than the
concrete. In grammar, the predicate `as->of->2023` has a higher inference level than the subject
`company->person->name`.

Continuing with inference levels in grammar; an adjective, adverb, preposition, or conjunction `as` would be more
abstract than a noun `2023`.
