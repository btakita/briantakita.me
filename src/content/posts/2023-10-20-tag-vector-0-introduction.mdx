description:
  tag vector is a name convention, & will eventually be a formal name system, where names are composed of tags
  connected by a 1 dimensional vector. It can be used for naming variables, functions, components, network apis, low
  code apps, & even in plain text.

Tag Vector aims to be a tool to solve the two hard things in Computed Science by providing a name convention &
eventually a formalized system with tools to:
<ul>
	<li>work with existing source code</li>
	<li>show how tags are connected by using a 1 dimensional vector</li>
	<li>understand the context of an abstraction just by looking at the tag vector</li>
	<li>the data structure shape of the abstraction can be encoded in the tag vector</li>
	<li>immutable names to allow a simple text search to find all usages of tags & tag vectors</li>
	<li>compose multi-dimension tag vectors</li>
	<li>
		{[
			`show the directional arrow of a tag vector in source code & text using font ligatures`,
			<Cite ctx={props.ctx} id={uuid_()}>
				The underscore arrow font ligatures will be developed in new fonts forked from popular existing fonts
			</Cite>
		]}
	</li>
	<li>store the tag vector in a vector database & automate querying tag graphs</li>
	<li>tag graphs can will enable linking to & a vector search for other usages of the tag, machine leaning algorithms, &
		domain-specific analysis.</li>
	<li>
		{[
			`write prose with an editor that understands the tag vector with tools that parse & act on the tag vector,
			rendering components & performing api calls`,
			<Cite ctx={props.ctx} id={uuid_()}>
				A prototype of the document editor with Tag Vector is in the works
			</Cite>
		]}
	</li>
</ul>

The Tag Vector system can provide profound benefits to computer science, programming, api design, domain design,
low code tooling, machine learning, & even plain text. The Tag Vector convention feels familiar to existing code
conventions & can be used with existing source code.
