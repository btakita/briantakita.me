description:
  tag vector is a name convention, will eventually be a formal name system, where names are composed of tags
  connected by a 1 dimensional vector. It can be used for naming variables, functions, components, network apis, low
  code apps, even in plain text.

Tag Vector aims to be a tool to solve the two hard things in Computed Science by providing a name convention &
eventually a formalized system with tools to:
<ul>
	<li>work with existing source code</li>
	<li>show how tags are connected by using a 1 dimensional vector</li>
	<li>understand the context of an abstraction just by looking at the tag vector</li>
	<li>the data structure shape of the abstraction can be encoded in the tag vector</li>
	<li>immutable names to allow a simple text search to find all usages of tags & tag vectors</li>
	<li>compose multi-dimension tag vectors</li>
	<li>
		<Van dom={
			V_fragment({ ctx },
				`show the directional arrow of a tag vector in source code & text using font ligatures`,
				V_footnote({ ctx, id: 'font-ligatures' },
					`The underscore arrow font ligatures will be developed in new fonts forked from popular existing fonts`))
		}/>
	</li>
	<li>store the tag vector in a vector database & automate querying tag graphs</li>
	<li>tag graphs can will enable linking to & a vector search for other usages of the tag, machine leaning algorithms, &
		domain-specific analysis.</li>
	<li>
		<Van dom={
			V_fragment({ ctx },
				`write prose with an editor that understands the tag vector with tools that parse & act on the tag vector,
				rendering components & performing api calls`,
				V_footnote({ ctx, id: 'tag-vector-editor-prototype' },
					`A prototype of the document editor with Tag Vector is in the works`))
		}/>
	</li>
</ul>

The Tag Vector system can provide profound benefits to computer science, programming, api design, domain design,
low code tooling, machine learning, even plain text. The Tag Vector convention feels familiar to existing code
conventions & can be used with existing source code.
