This releaseâ€¦

- Adds an icon for the Generic Query Analyzer
- Is refactored to remove a little used dll

I got some positive feedback on it so far. Let me know if you have any suggestions, requests or find some bugs.
Right now, the GQA implementation is well factored so its in a good position to move forward.
