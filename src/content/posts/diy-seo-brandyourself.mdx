The wonderful web makes it very easy for someone to publish their thoughts and opinions, good and bad, true and
false. If you find yourself at the wrong end of a post that shows up in your Google results, the implications can be
very damaging. It ceases to be a matter of truth, but a matter of marketing.

Fortunately, you can take control over your name on the web, without having to spend thousands of dollars that
online reputation repair firms charge.

Now I sit back and wait for Google to index the results :-)
