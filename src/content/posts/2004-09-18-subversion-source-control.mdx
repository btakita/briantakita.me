I really like Subversion because is it is fast, lightweight, and, when coupled with Tortise, easy to use,
administer, and set up.

Branching, merging, rollbacks, and conflict resolution are easy. Subversion makes source control fun, rather than a
chore like the other tools I used before.

Now, Im version controlling items that I edit, including my blog posts and articles.
