  I really like Subversion because is it is fast, lightweight, and, when coupled with Tortise, easy to use,

Branching, merging, rollbacks, and conflict resolution are easy. Subversion makes source control fun, rather than a
chore like the other tools I used before.

Now, Im version controlling items that I edit, including my blog posts and articles.

	`Subversion can be run on a desktop, file share, or as a web service. The web service interface for Subversion can
	be run off of its own svn server or `, atb_apache_(), `. If you use the svn server on a Windows server, you may
	want to consider using `,
	atb_({ href: 'https://web.archive.org/web/20051217083500/http://dark.clansoft.dk/~mbn/svnservice/' }, 'SVNService'),
	` to register the svn server as a Service.`
