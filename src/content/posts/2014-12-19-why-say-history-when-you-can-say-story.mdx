  In culture, we are taught to distinguish history & story as two separate concepts. Some (falsely) think of history
  being a masculine version of story (his story). However, history & story can be used interchangeably. Here's why.

## Story & History can be used Interchangeably

We already can use "story" in place of "history" since both are a recounting of events.

"History" can also be used in place of "story" since the vernacular usage of history includes fiction worlds, geological
events, & physical events.

The defining line is blurred. Story & History can be used Interchangeably. The usages of Story & History are
connected. Enjoy the connection.
