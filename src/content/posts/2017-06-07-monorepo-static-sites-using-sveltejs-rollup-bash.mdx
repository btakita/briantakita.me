  Building my old site briantakita.com using sveltejs, rollupjs, ctx-core, bash

		`This site was build using existing solutions such as `,
		<Atb_jeckyllrb/>,
		`, `,
		<Atb_wintersmithjs/>,

Some features that I found essential include:

* a development server with watch/build scripts
* generate static html files to serve from github.io
* isomorphic javascript

With these techs, the following is possible:

* static file builds
* server side rendering
* client side rendering

This means the entire html page can be rendered using svelte on the server (or static file) & svelte on the client
side (for dynamic components). This means there's no need for other rendering libraries like pug. Only svelte & raw
html strings are needed to gain all of the features of dynamic isomorphic components!

With this retooling, I will begin working on components to enhance the experience of authoring & reading
meaning-dense information.

Stay tuned&hellip;
