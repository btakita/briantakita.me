## Web 2.0, Ruby on Rails, startups

### Pivotal Labs
<p>
	{[
		`I was excited to get break into startups & responded to an ad in `,
		<Atb_craigslist/>,
		` by Jared Cosulich to collaborate on his startup `,
		<Atb_communitywalk/>,
		`. I helped with some features & bug fixes. He was working on funding & worked as a resident entrepreneur at `,
		<Atb_pivotal_labs/>,
		`. I was introduced to Rob Mee, Sherry Erskine, the team with a brand new Ruby on Rails practice.`
	]}
</p>
I joined Pivotal Labs (it was Pivotal Computing Systems back then). Pivotal Labs had many talented engineers. Nathan
Wilmes, Nathan Sobo, Nick Kallen, in particular, pushed me to become a better more innovative developer.
<p>
	{[
		`I started working with reactive programming since collaborating with Nathan Sobo on a ruby project called `,

		]}/>,
		`. I also worked on various open source projects focused on terse apis & Domain Driven Design`

</p>
<p>
	{[
		`I worked with creating composable plugins while working on `,
		<Atb_desertrb/>,
		`, which was the core of Pivotal's set of composable "social software" plugins. I got exposure to
		coherently managing multiple libraries in a single domain; some of these led to `,
		<Atb_monorepo innerText="monorepo"/>,
		` patterns that I use today.`
	]}
</p>
There were many projects that I had the fortune to be a part of at Pivotal, so it deserves it's own post. While I
got exposure to some of the best in the industry, many early stage start up projects, innovative open source projects,
was well respected, had some great friendships. After 4 years with Pivotal, I wanted to be with a company &
maintain a code base for the long run. I wanted to go deeper with maintaining single codebase to grow in my practice.
<p>
	{[
		`My final project @ Pivotal was with `,
		<Atb_honk/>,
		`. I liked working with the founders, Tom Taira, Stephanie Lacrosse, Bruce Krysiak. It was a smooth transition
		to be the Lead Product Developer on the product.`
	]}
</p>

### Honk

Honk was an automotive social information & sales startup. Honk built in social reviews, market price comparison,
vehicle information, preference matching to autos tools.
<p>
	{[
		`While working with `,
		<Atb_backbonejs/>,
		` at Honk, I found that state management was effective in maintaining complex apps.`
	]}
</p>

		partnership with `,

		` building. Honk also created the auto buying portal through a partnership with `,
		<Atb_wsj/>,
		` & `,
		<Atb_usaa/>,
		`.`
	]}
</p>
Work consisted of long hours to push out releases. I enjoyed the work though I was beginning to burn out & my personal
life was starting to fray. I sought to work from home & was not permitted to.
<p>
	{[
		`Around the time News Corp was going through the sale of My Space among other structural changes to it's Digital
		Division, the key partnership with News Corp was ending. Honk then pivoted to be acquired by `,

		`Around the time News Corp was going through the sale of My Space among other structural changes to it's Digital
		Division, the key partnership with News Corp was ending. Honk then pivoted to be acquired by `,
		<Atb_truecar/>,
		`. The stagnancy, grind of long hours, releases led me to look elsewhere for work. I got a job offer to work
		with `,
		<Atb_yammer/>,
		` led by Davis Sacks. I decided to stay with Honk, feeling sense of loyalty to stay onboard with the acquisition
		to TrueCar. I told David Sacks I will not be signing the offer; he told me "you are making a mistake". Given the
		early usage of `,
		<Atb_nodejs/>,
		`, `,
		<Atb_cassandra/>,
		`, the eventual acquisition by `,
		<Atb_microsoft/>,
		`, he is correct from the perspective of achieving business success.`
	]}
</p>

### Move to LA

LA appealed to me & I moved south to work @ TrueCar.

### TrueCar

Going from the startup Honk to integrating into the culture at TrueCar was tough. Working within a deep corporate
structure, with constrained tech options on fringe projects is not for everyone. After working long hours for
partnership accounts. I burn out & we parted ways. Perhaps I should have taken the Yammer job after all, but at
least I was in LA.

## Independent contracting & evolution of the practice

### Milyoni
<p>
	{[
		`My first independent contract began with the then "social entertainment" startup `,
		<Atb_milyoni/>,
		` (pronounced million-eye) located in Pleasanton, CA. Milyoni had a Rails app supporting Video on Demand & Live
		Online Events with time-coded chat & components synchronized with the Video on Demand. Live events had real-time
		chat & components. Ruby, being a relatively slow language, did not scale to support large online events. In
		light of the performance issues, I developed a chat & component server built in node.js & `,
		<Atb_redis/>,
		`, which handled the traffic well. When I began the project, we made an agreement with one of the founders that I
		would be working remotely in LA, where I lived. I agreed to move up to the Bay Area to help build the young team
		along with my old employer, Pivotal Labs. This lasted about a year. I had personal matters to take care of back in
		LA but the manager of the project wanted me on site, so I left.`

		` the same component code could be run on the browser & the server. Along with ctx-core, svelte stores could
		also be run on the browser & server. The server side was tricky with svelte stores alone, as requests would be
		handled concurrently. To solve the issue, a `,

</p>
ctx-core continued to evolve, from git submodules added to a project to a set of > 100 npm packages. The preferred
software stack changed:
<ul>
	<li>from riotjs with Backbone.js stores on a custom <Atb_expressjs/> server</li>
	<li>to sveltejs with svelte stores & sapper</li>
	<li>to <Atb_solidjs/> with <Atb_nanostores/> & <Atb_solid_start/></li>

		<Atb_jquery/>,
		` & Backbone.js toward SPA libraries. `,

## Multi Page Apps (MPA)`->`Single Page App (SPA) hybrids`->`Multi Page Apps
<p>
	{[
		`Ruby on Rails is a MPA with progressive enhancement support. It's Javascript integration has been a work in
		progress throughout the history of Rails. However, it cannot match the browser/server integrated development
		experience of isomorphic Javascript web frameworks. In the earlier days of Javascript component libraries, the
		Single Page App use case was emphasized. While there were some attempts at lean isomorphic Multi-page App libraries
		such as `,
		<Atb_marko/>,
		`, most of the javascript community focused on front-end Single Page App development, de-emphasizing Full Stack
		Development. Libraries such as `,
		<Atb_nextjs/>,
		`, `,
		<Atb_sapper/>,
		` (superceded by `,
		<Atb_svelte_kit/>,
		`), `,
		<Atb_solid_start/>,
		` added SSR progressive rendering to a SPA client side router. With the advent of libraries such as `,
		<Atb_astrojs/>,
		` isomorphic Javascript MPA development gained prominence. Marko was built almost a decade earlier, but Astro
		has gained significant popularity. Astro files are server-side rendered only. Astro's integration with many
		SSR + CSR component libraries makes it practical to have a full stack web app project across multiple libraries.`
	]}
</p>

### Hydration

Back during my time at Honk.com, I created a Rails library that provided a rich hydration api the Backbone.js model
in the browser. Rails, being a MPA written in Ruby, needed a way to efficiently send data from the server to the
browser during the page load. When moving to Javascript/Typescript SPAs, the component libraries were focused on
being a SPA library first & would have a separate progressive web app library to render the components on both the
server & the browser. They would bundle in a hydration library, which seems great. However, the general purpose
hydration libraries would be development intensive, opaque, bloated, slow, unreliable, often hydrates too much of
the component tree.
<p>
	{[
		`Astrojs provides `,
		<Atb href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#client-side-scripts">
			client side builds
		</Atb>,
		`, an independent browser build with the code inside of the `,
		<code>{`<script/>`}</code>,
		` tag. The Astrojs team pointed out techniques such as `,
		<Atb href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#definevars">
			passing variables
		</Atb>,
		` into the `,
		<code>{`<script/>`}</code>,
		` tags & `,
		<Atb href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#pass-frontmatter-variables-to-scripts">
			hydrating data using Web Components
		</Atb>,
		`. These tools make it practical to develop targeted custom code that is efficient in payload size & execution,
		transparent in it's logic, free of complex dependencies.`

### Technological Churn

<p>

		`The Rails/Ruby community & the Javascript community come from different roots. I had inside exposure with the Ruby
		on Rails community, seeing the ecosystems from different perspectives. During the rise & heyday of Rails,
		we saw Web 2.0 startups & the `,

		<Atb_ie6/>,
		` @ Honk then again @ TrueCar in 2010 while many other companies already stopped supporting the old browser.

	learn with MPAs, such as Rails & Marko did not factor into the early development. Early SPA developers coming from

</p>

### Dependencies & Migrations

As a developer sees many seasons, technologies change, fads emerge, maintaining apps based on old tech, migrating
to the latest set of development practices. Migration takes effort as there are differences between the domain of
the older & newer tech. A framework may go through large transitions throughout it's lifetime. Techniques to make
content & software easier to migrate save effort & time.

I developed ctx-core to be a consistent project to keep patterns & libraries supporting context dependency injection,
reactivity, & other tools to remain consistent during migration. Tag Vector enables the domain architecture to
remain flat & independent of software architecture. As the tech ecosystem changes & migrations are needed,
cohesive libraries under the programmer's control can aid in the transition.

# Next Steps

This post is long & covered more than the original intent. Graphs of detail provide context but add to length &
