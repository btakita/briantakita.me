## Web 2.0, Ruby on Rails, startups

### Pivotal Labs
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`I was excited to get break into startups & responded to an ad in `,
			V_atb_craigslist(props),
			` by Jared Cosulich to collaborate on his startup `,
			V_atb_communitywalk(props),
			`. I helped with some features & bug fixes. He was working on funding & worked as a resident entrepreneur at `,
			V_atb_pivotal_labs(props),
			`. I was introduced to Rob Mee, Sherry Erskine, the team with a brand new Ruby on Rails practice.`)
	}/>
</p>
I joined Pivotal Labs (it was Pivotal Computing Systems back then). Pivotal Labs had many talented engineers. Nathan
Wilmes, Nathan Sobo, Nick Kallen, in particular, pushed me to become a better more innovative developer.
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,

			` clicked for me, as the paradigm allows state to be composed of functions with reactive inputs & a single output.`
		)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,

	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`I worked with creating composable plugins while working on `,
			V_atb_desertrb(props),
			`, which was the core of Pivotal's set of composable "social software" plugins. I got exposure to
			coherently managing multiple libraries in a single domain; some of these led to `,
			V_atb_monorepo({ ...props, innerText: 'monorepo' }),
			` patterns that I use today.`)
	}/>
</p>
There were many projects that I had the fortune to be a part of at Pivotal, so it deserves it's own post. While I
got exposure to some of the best in the industry, many early stage start up projects, innovative open source projects,
was well respected, had some great friendships. After 4 years with Pivotal, I wanted to be with a company &
maintain a code base for the long run. I wanted to go deeper with maintaining single codebase to grow in my practice.
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`My final project @ Pivotal was with `,
			V_atb_honk(props),
			`. I liked working with the founders, Tom Taira, Stephanie Lacrosse, Bruce Krysiak. It was a smooth transition
			to be the Lead Product Developer on the product.`)
	}/>
</p>

### Honk

Honk was an automotive social information & sales startup. Honk built in social reviews, market price comparison,
vehicle information, preference matching to autos tools.
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`While working with `,
			V_atb_backbonejs(props),
			` at Honk, I found that state management was effective in maintaining complex apps.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`Tom & Stephanie have a long track record & deep connections in the automotive & automotive web industry. A
			partnership with `,
			V_atb_news_corp(props),
			`, building auto buying components, even providing an office in the `,
			V_atb_myspace(props),
			` building. Honk also created the auto buying portal through a partnership with `,
			V_atb_wsj(props),
			` & `,
			V_atb_usaa(props),
			`.`)
	}/>
</p>
Work consisted of long hours to push out releases. I enjoyed the work though I was beginning to burn out & my personal
life was starting to fray. I sought to work from home & was not permitted to.
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`Around the time News Corp was going through the sale of My Space among other structural changes to it's
			Digital Division, the key partnership with News Corp was ending. Honk then pivoted to be acquired by `,
			V_atb_truecar(props),
			`.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,

			Digital Division, the key partnership with News Corp was ending. Honk then pivoted to be acquired by `,
			V_atb_truecar(props),
			`. The stagnancy, grind of long hours, releases led me to look elsewhere for work. I got a job offer to work
			with `,
			V_atb_yammer(props),
			` led by Davis Sacks. I decided to stay with Honk, feeling sense of loyalty to stay onboard with the
			acquisition to TrueCar. I told David Sacks I will not be signing the offer; he told me "you are making a
			mistake". Given the early usage of node.js, `,
			V_atb_cassandra(props),
			`, the eventual acquisition by `,
			V_atb_microsoft(props),
			`, he is correct from the perspective of achieving business success.`)
	}/>
</p>

### Move to LA

LA appealed to me & I moved south to work @ TrueCar.

### TrueCar

Going from the startup Honk to integrating into the culture at TrueCar was tough. Working within a deep corporate
structure, with constrained tech options on fringe projects is not for everyone. After working long hours for
partnership accounts. I burn out & we parted ways. Perhaps I should have taken the Yammer job after all, but at
least I was in LA.

## Independent contracting & evolution of the practice

### Milyoni
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`My first independent contract began with the then "social entertainment" startup `,
			V_atb_milyoni(props),
			` (pronounced million-eye) located in Pleasanton, CA. Milyoni had a Rails app supporting Video on Demand & Live
			Online Events with time-coded chat & components synchronized with the Video on Demand. Live events had real-time
			chat & components. Ruby, being a relatively slow language, did not scale to support large online events. In
			light of the performance issues, I developed a chat & component server built in node.js & `,
			V_atb_redis(props),
			`, which handled the traffic well. When I began the project, we made an agreement with one of the founders that I
			would be working remotely in LA, where I lived. I agreed to move up to the Bay Area to help build the young team
			along with my old employer, Pivotal Labs. This lasted about a year. I had personal matters to take care of back in
			LA but the manager of the project wanted me on site, so I left.`)
	}/>
</p>

### Rundavoo
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`I then joined `,
			V_atb_rundavoo(props),
			` & created `,
			V_atb({ ctx: props.ctx,
				innerText: 'backbone-signal',
				href: '/posts/backbone-signal-practical-reactive-programming-javascript'}),
			` as a library for reactive state management, which I used with `,
			V_atb_riotjs(props),
			` to render the front-end. I joined the company fairly late, sadly it was having funding issues. I stayed
			onboard as everyone else left hoping to help rescue the company with a lean staff.  Sadly, Rundavoo ended up
			folding & I was owed a sizable outstanding balance.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`Out of paying work, I went on a personal journey of sorts, visiting up & down the West Coast. During this
			journey, my `,
			V_atb_worldview({ ...props, innerText: 'worldview' }),
			` expanded with experimenting with the `,
			V_atb_ontology({ ...props, innerText: 'ontological' }),
			` expression of a `,
			V_atb_philosophy(props),
			`. During this exploration, I explored how word `,
			V_atb_definition({ ...props, innerText: 'definitions' }),

### Censible
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`I then consulted for `,
			V_atb_censible(props),
			`, which pivoted from a `,
			V_atb_esg(props),
			` Investment platform targeting millennials to apps presenting company ESG information, a stock screener, a

			`. I leaned on my explorations with Ontology create the tag vector Convention`,
			V_footnote({ ...props, id: 'tag-vector-development-continues' },
				`Work on the tag vector Convention continues. Through much iteration, it reached a stable design in 2020.
				This design has been verified with real-world development since. I will write a formal definition & history
				soon.`
			),
			` to enable a simple, flat architecture. We also switched from riotjs`,
			code(`-->`),
			V_atb_sveltejs(props),
			`.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`I appreciated the design of `,
			V_atb_svelte_stores(props),
			` & for reactive state management. With the introduction of `,
			V_atb_sapper(props),
			` the same component code could be run on the browser & the server. Along with ctx-core, svelte stores could
			also be run on the browser & server. The server side was tricky with svelte stores alone, as requests would be
			handled concurrently. To solve the issue, a `,
			code('ctx'),
			`(context) object would be created when the server request starts. A `,
			code('Be'),
			` function would take the `,
			code('ctx'),
			` & to store the value returned by the `,
			code('Be'),
			`, which would be the svelte store.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`The Censible project was off & on for a few years. During this time I picked up some other projects including `,

			`, various other small sites. After Censible, I now collaborate with a related ESG financial advisor `,
			V_atb_martin_investments(props),
			`.`)
	}/>
</p>
ctx-core continued to evolve, from git submodules added to a project to a set of > 100 npm packages. The preferred
software stack changed:
<Van dom={
	ul(
		li(
			`from riotjs with Backbone.js stores on a custom `,
			V_atb_expressjs(props),
			` server`),
		li(`to sveltejs with svelte stores & sapper`),
		li(`to `, V_atb_solidjs(props), ` with `, V_atb_nanostores(props), ` & `, V_atb_solid_start(props)),
		li(`to solidjs with Nano Stores & `, V_atb_astrojs(props)))
}/>

## Why not use React?
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`The javascript world in late 2010s & early 2020s had much in it's move away from `,
			V_atb_jquery(props),
			` & Backbone.js toward SPA libraries. `,

			` became the dominant front-end component rendering library.`)

<p>
	<Van dom={

				href: 'https://dev.to/this-is-learning/how-react-isn-t-reactive-and-why-you-shouldn-t-care-152m',
			}, `React is not Reactive`),
			` by default. There are libraries that can add reactivity to React, like NanoStores & `,
			V_atb_signals_react(props),
			`. React works with the virtual dom where I would rather work with the real DOM. Along with a `,
			V_atb({ ctx: props.ctx, href: 'https://dev.to/joetex/react-why-so-complicated-3dc7' },
			 'complicated API'),
			` & a need for many dependencies to extend it's default behavior, I never got into React. I still cannot force
			myself to use React. It's not a natural fit to my mental model of developing web apps. I have grown to
			appreciate contributions made by the React ecosystem.`)
	}/>
</p>
<p>
	<Van dom={

				For large stateful component trees, a component library with declarative state management (SolidJS, Svelte,
				React, etc.) is more practical.`),
			`.`)

</p>
## Multi Page Apps (MPA)`->`Single Page App (SPA) hybrids`->`Multi Page Apps
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`Ruby on Rails is a MPA with progressive enhancement support. It's Javascript integration has been a work in
			progress throughout the history of Rails. However, it cannot match the browser/server integrated development
			experience of isomorphic Javascript web frameworks. In the earlier days of Javascript component libraries, the
			Single Page App use case was emphasized. While there were some attempts at lean isomorphic Multi-page App
			libraries such as `,
			V_atb_marko(props),
			`, most of the javascript community focused on front-end Single Page App development, de-emphasizing Full
			Stack Development. Libraries such as `,
			V_atb_nextjs(props),
			`, `,
			V_atb_sapper(props),
			` (superceded by `,
			V_atb_sveltejs(props),
			`), `,
			V_atb_solid_start(props),
			` added SSR progressive rendering to a SPA client side router. With the advent of libraries such as `,
			V_atb_astrojs(props),
			` isomorphic Javascript MPA development gained prominence. Marko was built almost a decade earlier, but Astro
			has gained significant popularity. Astro files are server-side rendered only. Astro's integration with many
			SSR + CSR component libraries makes it practical to have a full stack web app project across multiple libraries.`)
	}/>
</p>

### Hydration

Back during my time at Honk.com, I created a Rails library that provided a rich hydration api the Backbone.js model
in the browser. Rails, being a MPA written in Ruby, needed a way to efficiently send data from the server to the
browser during the page load. When moving to Javascript/Typescript SPAs, the component libraries were focused on
being a SPA library first & would have a separate progressive web app library to render the components on both the
server & the browser. They would bundle in a hydration library, which seems great. However, the general purpose
hydration libraries would be development intensive, opaque, bloated, slow, unreliable, often hydrates too much of
the component tree.
<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,
			`Astrojs provides `,
			V_atb({ ctx: props.ctx, href: 'https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#client-side-scripts' },

			`, an independent browser build with the code inside of the `,

				`hydrating data using Web Components`),
			`. These tools make it practical to develop targeted custom code that is efficient in payload size & execution,
			 transparent in it's logic, free of complex dependencies.`)

### Technological Churn

<p>
	<Van dom={
		V_fragment(props,

			V_atb_ie6(props),
			` @ Honk then again @ TrueCar in 2010 while many other companies already stopped supporting the old browser.

<p>
	As the front-end developers built their tooling & architectures, Single Page Apps gained prominence. The lessons
	learn with MPAs, such as Rails & Marko did not factor into the early development. Early SPA developers coming from
	Full Stack backgrounds, yearned to fix the browser/server integration issues with full stack frameworks through
	the SPA. A clean client/server break.

### Dependencies & Migrations

As a developer sees many seasons, technologies change, fads emerge, maintaining apps based on old tech, migrating
to the latest set of development practices. Migration takes effort as there are differences between the domain of
the older & newer tech. A framework may go through large transitions throughout it's lifetime. Techniques to make
content & software easier to migrate save effort & time.

I developed ctx-core to be a consistent project to keep patterns & libraries supporting context dependency injection,
reactivity, & other tools to remain consistent during migration. Tag Vector enables the domain architecture to
remain flat & independent of software architecture. As the tech ecosystem changes & migrations are needed,
cohesive libraries under the programmer's control can aid in the transition.

# Next Steps

This post is long & covered more than the original intent. Graphs of detail provide context but add to length &
create rabbit-holes. I will end this post for now & extract out posts over the next few weeks.
