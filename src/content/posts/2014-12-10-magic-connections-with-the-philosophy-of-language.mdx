  Magic exists! Well, if you have listened to me lately, you will hear that everything exists (including fiction).
  When everything exists, we can recapture the entirety of language from those who impose restrictions on Existence.
  We have all heard "that does not exist". We can now say, "that" does exist & "that" is a useful concept.

## Magic Connections with the Philosophy of Language

Not having a formal training in Philosophy, it's been my pleasure to come across the Philosophy of Language. I've
arrived at a similar approach from my life experience, however it is great to see that there is a Philosophical
tradition with a similar focus.

It's quite magical that patterns in Existence repeat in many different Domains. It's a tragedy culture has separated
many Domains in Existence. A notable schism was when rational materialistic science separated from esoteric
spirituality.

Any "ism" tends to restrict the adherent's scope on Existence, restricting the connections that entity has within
Existence. This may rob the adherents to the "ism" the ability to utilize similar patterns in different domains, to
make connections with adherents of other domains, and can ultimately lead to objectification of others.

Language has a magical effect on entities. Language sets the conceptual scope of the entities that communicate with
each other. Language also sets the conceptual scope of rational, symbolic logic. Language is spoken by the voice in
our heads. Language influences the thoughts & context of the entities that listen.

Marketing entities understand the power of language & images. That's why Marketing departments & politicians spend
hours picking the right name & terminology. That's why you see ads defining & redefining words for the audience.
That's why some people are given labels, like "terrorist", "freedom fighter", "anarchist", "republican", "democrat",
etc. These words affect the perceived identities of the people with the labels. These words make it easy to kill, to
oppress, & to ignore.

	blockquote_(p_(
		`Communication of thoughts and feelings through a system of arbitrary signals, such as voice sounds, gestures,
		or written symbols.`)),
	p_(
		`We can expand the scope of Language to be utilized by any entity signaling another entity. That means plants
		have Language (`,
		tb_a_({ href: 'http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/what-plants-talk-about-video-full-episode/8243/'},
			'What Plants Talk About'),
		`). Stars have Language. The Universe itself has Language. Concepts have Language.`)

## Awareness of the Ecosystem of Language

Language is an evolutionary ecosystem of the culture's mindshare & heartshare by those who propagate definitions &
meaning. Language influences (even determines) how we, as a culture, act. We, as participating entities, have the
power to be aware of & change the language. We can influence each other to become harmonious, loving, intelligent,
peaceful, beautiful, playful, creative, magical.

Language is also a tool of empowerment. Awareness of context & choice of words effectively shape your mental model &
the model of those who listen to you. Language, in it's many forms, is a key tool that has been Expanding
Consciousness of Life.

Be aware! Expand consciousness! Peace & Love!
