		`I'm pleased to announce `, atb_rmemo_(), `, a tiny no-fluff reactive state library. rmemo is the reactive core
		of `, atb_relementjs_(),`, a server & browser UI rendering library that I also released.`

## Motivation

<R $={[
	`Until recently I was using `, atb_nanostores_(), ` for my goto state management solution. I contributed to fixing
	diamond dependency issues. I also wrote some extension libraries`,
	footnote_c_({ ctx, id: 'ctx-core-nanostore' },
		atb_ctx_core_nanostores_(), ` & `, atb_ctx_core_solid_nanostores_()),
	`.
	Nanostores is smallish, usable on the server & browser, & works with any UI rendering library. All seemed well & I
	used Nanostores for some large projects. However, the api is cumbersome in a few ways..., particularly with `, code_
	(`computed`), `.`,
	code_(`computed`), ` requires it's parents to be listed as arguments.`,
]}/>

```ts
import { atom, computed } from 'nanostores'
const id$ = atom(1)
const user$ =
```
