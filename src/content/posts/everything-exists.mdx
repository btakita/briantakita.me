  Does God exist? Surely, Santa Claus & Unicorns do not exist.
  Yet we are talking about them. If they don't exist, why & how am I talking about them? Santa Claus & Unicorns do exist, as fictional characters; more on God later. Everything Exists. The concept conceptually exists. It may also physically exist; like the men who name themselves Santa Claus.

Does God exist? Surely, Santa Claus & Unicorns do not exist. Yet we are talking about them. If they don't exist, why
& how am I talking about them?

Surely this must be a cheat; Some sort of sleight of hand; Missing the point. However...

## It's All About the Context

Words are fuzzy patterns. A word in different situations has a different meaning. A word has different meanings
between speaker & listener.

Adding context gives precise meaning. An atheist can accurately say; God does not exist in my belief system or I
don't believe in God; denying the need for God, yet having compassion for someone else's belief system. Religious
believers can have compassion for all nonbelievers, as there are many interdependent tribes on Earth.

## Everything is Governed by Nature

The nature of Physical & Conceptual Existence follows behaviour that we can study using the arts (spirituality
included) & sciences. Supernatural phenomena is caused by unknown Natural Law.

## The Nature of God is Defined by each Person

God is a concept, who's meaning is as individual as the person who hold it.

God, to me, is Existence (conceptual & physical). Every person has a belief system. The simple abstraction of the
belief system is the God, even if we don't call it God.

God involves creation. Our feelings, thoughts, & actions create God; We can create God the jealous, wrathful, &
cruel; We can create God the loving, compassionate, & nurturing.

## The Need for Exoteric Religion?

A person's belief system influences the person's thoughts, actions, & interpretations.

		'impose a belief system composed of some outdated traditions. There are unifying ethics that create harmony with ' +
		'self & others, however these ethics can be taught without Exoteric Religion.'

## Our Nature & Calling

Having compassion for ourselves & each other connects us in harmonious interdependence. A symbiotic spiral of
evolving intelligence, love, dignity.

When we love, respect, & have compassion for ourselves & each other, we live.
