What happens when we become a muse to our tools?

When YouTube suggests videos that cater to your proclivities, what you see in your feed will be a reflection on your
conscious attention domain.

Would the nature of modern conscious enlightenment be a sort of leveling-up administered by machine learning algorithms?

Would we be better off if we consciously create & choose our tools? When would it make sense to take what is easily
given with all the consequences? When would it make sense to create a tool that purely fulfills a need without
unwanted attachments?

Some "it depends" questions to consider&hellip;
