I have a few gems on Rubyforge and I want to track how many of them were downloaded. I found Firefox's search tools
lacking to find my gem rr.

To fix this issue, I made a sake task, named `gems:downloads:list`, that prints the gem downloads in text.

<R $={p_(
	`The source is on `, atb_({ href: 'http://pastie.caboo.se/79547' }, 'caboo.se'), `.`
)}/>

You can install it by using:

```sh
sudo gem install sake
sake -i http://pastie.caboo.se/79547.txt gems:downloads:list
sake gems:downloads:list | less
```

This will give an output like:
```

Sake is way cool. It was just too easy to implement and deploy this. Have fun making your own sake tasks.
